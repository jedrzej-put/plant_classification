# Plant classification with Convolution Neural Network

## Usage

### Instalation

```
git clone https://github.com/jedrzej-put/plant_classification.git
cd plant_classification
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install requirements.txt
```

### Data

First way:

Create data directory(in plant_classification) with subdirectories "healthy" and "sick" which include apppriate images.
Check configs/base.yaml (fields healthy_data_path and sick_data_path).

Second way:

Set absolute paths to "healthy" and "sick" directories in configs/base.yaml (fields healthy_data_path and sick_data_path)

### Configuration

You can edit:

- Hyperparameters
- Scheduler parameters
- Transformations
- Data path
- Tensorboard and MLflow parameter

To use mlflow you have to set environment variable "MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI"

```
EXPORT MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=<YOUR_MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI>
```

### Train model

```
python scripts/classification-script.py
```

### Display results

Check "./logs" directory. Find directory start with your experiment name and choose your experiment(if you two or more experiments with the same name, the log path to second and subsequent experiments will have a postfix with the experiment number).
Run "tensorboard --logdir logs/\<experiment_name\>\<experiment_number\>"

e.g.

```
tensorboard --logdir logs/test_experiment
```

```
tensorboard --logdir logs/test_experiment2
```

## Technology

- python 3.10.4
- torch==2.1.1
- torchmetrics==1.2.1
- torchvision==0.16.1
- pillow==9.0.1
- tensorboard
- mlflow
- scikit-learn

## Data

- The original data includes two plants:
  - rye
    - healthy
    - sick, infected with Rust
  - beet
    - healthy
    - sick infected with Cercospora beticola

## Tasks

- loading data, cleaning data
- random under sampling
- adding and compare approach with preprocessing step with own trained Unet(preparation mask with Label Studio):
  - segmentation infected leaves
  - segmentation spots of diseases
- inferencing segmentaion model
- building pipelines with preprocessing step
- building CNN model
- training, validating and testing CNN model
- saving metrics and model
- performing experiments

## Problems

- small number of images therefore sometimes only a few images on the test
- unbalanced datasets
- various data source
- various data distribution - main reason to create preprocessing with segmantation spots of disease
